# A 5-minute read: Gaps and Misunderstandings about modern terminology in energy Transition 
As a student with a multidisciplinary background, when I started my journey with Energy transition, one of the struggles I faced was the understanding of the new terms, in the market. Especially, when the terminology is new, so does the definition of the terms. I also noticed many confusions and misconceptions towards the modern term from even professionals who worked under Chemical Industries for decades. 

The novelty is always something that I am excited and curious about, but at the same time, it can backfire in different ways that I didn’t see coming. For example, as I currently work on the process of Steam Methane Reforming, along with Carbon Capture, I somehow find many valuable insights that I never seem to understand before starting to work on my Master thesis. When I started my Hydrogen Systems and Enabling Technologies master’s degree, I faced many challenges in understanding the fundamentals, given that I don’t possess a chemical or energy engineering background. Lately, while working on my thesis, I had a random thought that how ironic it is that I worked on an Industrial project under Methane production from Hydrogen and now, my thesis is Hydrogen production from methane. Despite technically, both the processes are far more diverse to simply say that they are the opposite of each other.

But, when I realised, it was very strange that how similar these two processes are in generic observation and I also started thinking about how I worked under Carbon Capture in both my Industrial Project and now, under my Master thesis. Then it hit me, that there was no Carbon capture in Methane production, it has always been the Utilisation of the captured carbon. Somehow, I was so focused on Carbon capture back then, without realising that was…irrelevant, in that context of the Industrial challenge at least. I think it also happens with a lot of professionals while navigating different backgrounds and new terminology, when there are not much clear explanations available consistently. 

When it comes to CCUS, I think it is more of a generic term and possess different industries, under the blanket. Most of us don’t realise that Carbon Capture is not the same as Utilisation and Storage. The Carbon utilisation itself is a different market and contributes to the net-zero goals. I think generalisation of the technologies as CCUS, lacks the understanding towards the intricacies of the actual volume of the market. It is also observed that most of the literature uses terms such as CO<sub>2</sub> conversion or CO<sub>2</sub> reduction (To clarify: The terms are not referred to the chemical reactions with carbon), but these are far more different than CC or CCU, in the modern terms. Even in some other literature, the terms are more generically mentioned as CCUS or Carbon Recycling, which is creating puzzlement when it comes to Literature review, due to the availability of broad terminology under this field.

It is the same with the different colours of Hydrogen. When I started studying about Blue Hydrogen production, I tried to understand the different colours of the hydrogen as a fundamental step. But the more I read, the more inconsistencies I found and the more confused I got. Despite being the basic colours that are followed in the market like Blue, Green and Grey, the different colours include turquoise, white, brown, pink, red or black. Despite being advantageous in categorizing the pathways of production of Hydrogen, The Hydrogen spectrum is still considered to be misleading in most of the cases.[2], [3], [4]

I think it is underrated struggle that many people face, in the field, as like me. Since, The field is still evolving continuously, it is expected to retrieve consistent near-absolute data and definitions in the future.
